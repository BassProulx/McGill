## Motivation for this repo
I have been whining for years about the flaws of science, or rather of the social system for scientific production. I took a few depressions and a pandemic to finally to finally stop worrying and start working openly. Skipping on the details, I will just say that the open science mindset is so much more confortable than the standard one. I must not lie though, it is hard work to change the workflow. I however strongly beleive the individual efficiency loss is nothing compared to the collective efficiency gain. That is probably what makes the process so exciting to me--"finally ALL my work will turnout at least a little usefull". I could go on and explain in detail how open science can be awesome (it is in my opinion not awesome yet, but getting there). There is plenty of hard and soft litterature on that so I'll let the reader make its own mind. I will instead take the opportinuty here to document my personal process for my transistion toward open science, hoping to fill what seems to be a gap in collective knowledge and respond to the comment I have always myself made: "yeah, open science principals are great, but how can I personally make the transition?".
