    "* There is a lot out there in terms of resources, tools and communities\n",
    "* There is so much that you will likely feel at a loss\n",

    "To avoid distress and discouragement, I recommend to:\n",
    "* Don't try anything if you are tight on deadlines\n",
    "* Be patient, you will unlikely quickly find what you are looking for\n",
    "* Be willing to experiment\n",
    "* Get a good password manager (I simply use the one of Firefox), it makes much easier to try stuff out\n",
    "* Take the time to connect with the community, the best way to get direction\n"
